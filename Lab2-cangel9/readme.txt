README — Snail Bait (from scratch) Complete + Lab 2 files

Structure
- index.html / style.css / game.js  → complete, runnable canvas game (no external assets required).
- lab2-2.1.html/.css/.js           → background pattern experiment (swap patterns freely).
- lab2-2.2.html/.css/.js + favicon.ico → favicon experiment.
- lab2-2.3.js                      → debug/profiling hooks; open DevTools → Performance.
- lab2-3.1.js / lab2-3.2.js        → Chapter 3 Problem 1–2 placeholders (ready for your changes).
- lab2-3.4.txt                     → observations for Problem 4 (50+ words).

How to run
1) Open index.html to play the complete version.
2) Open lab2-2.1.html or lab2-2.2.html to see the same game with the relevant lab changes.
3) Use Chrome/Edge DevTools → Performance to record a profile. Watch the custom 'render' measures.

Notes
- All code here is original and built for your class; it doesn’t copy from the textbook repo.
- If your instructor wants Problem 1–2 changes in code, edit lab2-3.1.js and lab2-3.2.js and import them into index.html.
